          On November 16, 2019, around 100 students from 9 different
          universities on the East Coast came to Princeton’s Friend Center to
          redesign today’s technology to be more humane and socially
          responsible. We established partnerships with industry leaders such as
          IDEO and Adobe to provide skills and design thinking-based workshops.

          The result of a full day of ideation, designing, and implementation
          was 27 thought-provoking prototypes created by students of diverse
          backgrounds and majors, from engineering to history to philosophy.
          When fully implemented, these projects can improve digital wellbeing
          and decrease user bias in modern consumer tech products. All of the
          Rehack projects can be found

          Many of the projects were further refined after the event and went on
          to compete in competitions, including the Princeton E-Club Pitch and
          Hult Prize Princeton. Student feedback from the event include “[we]
          got some amazing insights on how to design projects”, “loved [the
          keynote speaker]”, and “phenomenal mentorship”. Rehack’s work was also
          featured by Headstream, a mental health tech accelerator backed by the
          Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and students also had the
          opportunity to continue their projects with Headstream.

          This spring, we wanted to continue our theme of examining
          relationships between technology and people, and we also wanted to
          provide extracurricular opportunities in the time of quarantine for
          students at home. We set up Rehack Talks, a series of virtual sessions
          with topics including human-device interaction, design thinking in
          social systems, and digital wellbeing. Our guests to date include
          Jeffrey Bernstein (Design Director at Apple), Mauricio Miller
          (2019-2020 Visiting Professor of Entrepreneurship in the Keller
          Center), and Zena Loxton (Australian creative technologist, filmmaker,
          and writer). These talks were open to the entire Princeton community
          and over 145 people confirmed attendance across all 3 talks. The talks
          were very well received, with students claiming that the diverse
          mindsets of the speakers were “super insightful and helpful” to their
          everyday experiences.
